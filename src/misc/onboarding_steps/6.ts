    HACS is mainly developed/maintained by a single person (<hacs-link
      url="https://github.com/ludeeus"
      >@ludeeus</hacs-link
    >), because of this it can take some time before issues are looked at and
    pull requests are reviewed.
  </p>
  <p>
    While you have read through this onboarding section, HACS has started to get
    information about the repositories it knows, so you will already now see
    items in under the store pages.
