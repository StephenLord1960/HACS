    The first time you start Home Assistant with HACS enabled it needs to get information about every repository it knows.</br> It is important that you let it finish this process before you restart Home Assistant, if you restart before it's finished it will need to start over.

  <p>When it's done you will no longer see the progress bar.</p>
  <hacs-progressbar .active=${true}></hacs-progressbar>
